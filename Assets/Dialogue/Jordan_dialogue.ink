//Jordan (32)

- "Excuse me, sir. Your assistance, if you please.
- Found myself in a bit of a bind, I've ingested some questionable mushrooms, not exactly a survival expert move, I admit.
- I'm Jordan, supposed to be savvy in these situations, but it seems I've slipped up. My stomach's giving me grief.
- All I require are some basic medicinal herbs, and I'll bounce back swiftly.
- Any chance you know someone who can aid in this matter?
- That'd be splendid.
- If you could lend a hand, much appreciated.
- Apologies for the brief chat, but duty calls, and I need to recline immediately."
